# Basic Neural Networks
This repo contains the code for a very basic neural network without using any framework such Tensorflow, PyTorch etc. The Neural Network has been created using only Numpy. 

1. The first Program is a neural network which contains only 2 layers (input and output)

2. The second Program is a neural network which contains 3 layers (input, hidden and output)
